== Asciidoctor Markup Language

*IN* these days of fast paced application development, it's GR8 to have a simple markup language and tool to write stuff. The asciidoctor tool gives us a quick performing ruby gem we can use to write up documentation and reference materials. We can write them quickly, then translate them into either +HTML+ or +Docbook+ output.

Here is an overview of the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[Asciidoctor Syntax^]. It's a simple markup language and it comes with a Ruby Gem. The markup syantax is based on an earlier effort named asciidoc and you can read more about that http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[here^]. Review their http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[style guide here^].

This document is written in the  asciidoctor markup language.

So +gem install asciidoctor+ using the guide http://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/[here^]. Then you can write a simple sample plain text file using an editor without funny stuff. Follow the syntax guide above. Then when you're ready, you can do this from a terminal command line like  we did here to create this document. This text file is named *anynines.adoc* and after +asciidoctor+ ran, we had an output file named *anynines.html* in the same directory.s
