== Your {doctitle}

NOTE: We assume you've reviewed available technologies and found image:../../images/cloudfoundry.png[Cloud Foundry, link="http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html"] to be a good choice. 

=== Introduction

To make use of the princles of cloud computing, it's vital to be able to deploy business applications to a cloud computing service. These applications typically let our customers conduct business with us. The services we provide to them can be built upon layers of technologies that use standard tools and practices of our industry. 

Solutions like http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html[Cloud Foundry] Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS), offer a standard set of features, persistence and messaging services and attachment points. 


IMPORTANT: *Anynines  offers you and your clients this solution !* image:../../images/anynines.png[Anynines, 25, 25, link="http://www.anynines.com"]

=== The Manual Trail - the *CF* Deployment Tool

image:../../images/download1a.png[Download War File, 418, 249 link="/download",float="right"] 

Do you have our sample war file ? Yes, you will need that. And also the ruby gem called *CF*. We found a tutorial for Windows XP users http://jnorthr.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/install-cloud-foundry-cf-command-line-tool-part-two/[here] if you need to install this tool, and consult our Facts page for other variations.  

Please note that soon there will be a new version of this command line tool. It's written in the *GO* programming language and, unlike the Ruby gem, it will have all it's own code as a single executable program, so we won't need an installed Ruby environment. 

This new version is version six, or we could say *CF v6*. It has expanded functionality too. Keep an eye out for that development.

We're working on more details here to explain the file and folder structure conventions used within this guide. As you only need our war file for this trail, we'll skip that for now.

Since you wanted more detail, let's jump to our specific tutorial for that. link:/uploadmanual[Click Here].
