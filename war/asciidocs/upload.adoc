== Your {doctitle}

NOTE: We assume you've reviewed available technologies and found image:../../images/cloudfoundry.png[Cloud Foundry, link="http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html"] to be a good choice. 

=== Introduction

To make use of the princles of cloud computing, it's vital to be able to deploy business applications to a cloud computing service. These applications typically let our customers conduct business with us. The services we provide to them can be built upon layers of technologies that are based on standards used by the industry. 

Solutions like http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html[Cloud Foundry] Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS), offer a standard set of features, persistence and messaging services and attachment points.

=== The Manual Trail - the CF Deployment Tool

Do you have our sample war file ? image:../../images/download1a.png[Download War File, 314, 186 link="/download",float="right"]. Yes, you will need that. Also the ruby gem called *CF* but soon there will be a new version of this command line tool. It's written in the *GO* programming language and, unlike the Ruby gem, it will have all it's own code as a single executable program, so we will not need an installed Ruby environment. This new version is version six, or we could say *CF v6*. It has expanded functionality too. Keep an eye out for that development.

Since you wanted more detail, let's jump to our specific tutorial for that. link:/uploadmanual[Click Here].
