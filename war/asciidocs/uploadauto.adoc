:description: Notes from a sample upload session. A series of notes, joblogs and references from our + 
documentation team. To give you a better understanding of the automatic upload process to our platform, we've included notes about what you need to change in the build.gradle script.

WARNING: Before using this guide, the *_anynines.zip_* file must be available in your local system.

== Your Automatic Upload Tutorial

=== Introduction

To get you up to speed and familiar with the anynines upload process, we've made this project with everything needed to make it happen. We won't focus on the technical issues or implementation steps to do this. We'll only cover the changes we need in our automated build script. After a few changes to the build script, we can upload a full application to anynines.com using a single command.


=== What You Need

++++
<ul>
<li>Have a membership account with Anynines. Follow our <a href="/signup">Sign Up</a> tutorial if you need to join us.</li>
<li>Have the email address and password of your Anynines membership.</li>
<li>Have a working internet connection.</li>
<li>Have a plain text editor.</li>
<li>Have downloaded the full zip file from our <a href="/download">download page</a>.</li>
</ul>
++++

=== Get Ready

==== Get Zip File

Download the full zip file from our link:download[download page].

==== Move It To Convenient Location

Create a new diretory folder in a convenient location on your system. Move or copy the zip file to it.

==== Uncompress The Zip File

The zip file holds the compressed content of our project. It is a standard format, compressed file. You should be able to uncompress / unzip it after you move it using typical tools you already have.

==== Review Contents

image:../../images/folderStructure.png[Directory folder structure after decompression, float="right"] After the project is decompressed into your target location, it will have a folder name of *anynines*. Here's an image showing typical project content. Your version may differ as we evolve this tutorial. Don't worry! This is normal.

There are several directories of pieces we use to build our application. To learn more about how we structure our project, please review the *Project Components* topic or skip to the section below to learn about editing the gradle build script.



== Project Components

The full build tool we use to upload our app is included here. It's the *gradle* build tool. We've created a small wrapper version for you and put that into your project. You don't even need to know this level of detail. There are no changes needed in any of the following pieces. If you're in a hurry, skip to the section below about editing the gradle build script.

=== Use The Gradle Wrapper

Just for your information, if you'd like more info about the gradle build tool and it's purposes, and what it does +

== Gradle Build Script Editing

=== Values To Be Changed

We need to adjust these items before we try to upload an app

++++
<ul>
<li>username - your email address goes here</li>
<li>password - your password for Anynines goes here</li>
<li>your application name in both the URI and APPLICATION declarations - pick your app's name here</li>
<li>organization name - a way to structure your online apps</li>
<li>FILE location (possibly) - probably won't need to fix this, but just in case</li>
</ul>
++++

=== Edit This

image:../../images/build1.png[Gradle Build Script, float="right", role="thumb"] 

Ok, so here is where we need to adjust several values in our build script. 

Take a look at the image here that shows a fragment of our +build.gradle+ text file. 

The items we need to fix can be found within the +{+ and the +}+ characters after the word 'cloudfoundry', which is what our Anynines platform uses. It's about half way down your script.


=== Fix Username

image:../../images/build2.png[Gradle Build Script, float="right", role="thumb" ] 

In this example, our ficticious friend Martin used his email address to deploy his 'hotdog' app to Anynines. 

You'll need to remove his email address within the ' single quote marks and replace it with the email address you used to join Anynines. 

This example was for some testing we did earlier.

''''

TIP: Gradle scripts allow remarks and comments when double / char.s are before the comment, i.e. //

++++
<br />
++++

Your copy of our +build.gradle+ text file might show *//username=''  ''* and the +//+ bit makes this line of text invisible to the gradle tool. Gradle treats text after the +//+ sequence as a remark or comment.

So if you see +//+ just remove it and put your email address within the +++' '+++ marks. You should end up with something like *username=''men@work.com''*  but with your email. 


=== Fix Password

In our example, our ficticious friend Martin used his password and you can see the +***+ value within +''+ marks. 

If you see +//+ in your script just remove them and put your password within the *''* marks. You should end up with something like 

[quote]
password='' monkeyshines ''

but with your password there.

=== Fix Organization

image:../../images/build3.png[Gradle Build Script]

After you become familiar with cloud foundry application structures, you can pick more useful names for your organization. 

For now, just use your email address as the organization but replace dots and @ chars with _ underscore chars. 

For example, _martin.j.quickman@googlemail.com_ became _martin_j_quickman_googlemail_com_

=== Fix Name of Your App

image:../../images/build4.png[Gradle Build Script]

Want to deploy another app named +hotdog+ ? No ? Well better change martin's +hotdog+ app name to your own choice. Put that in both the middle of the uri name and also as the application name.

=== Fix Name of Your War File

image:../../images/build5.png[Gradle Build Script]

You might not need to change this. If you've unzipped our archive without changing the name of the folder from +anynines+ to something else, then you can leave the war file name as it is. 

The  +gradlew war+ command makes an archive of our application. This archive is known as a web archive or war. The war file name is the same as the name of our project diretory. If you renamed our +anynines+ project folder into a folder named +fred17+ then the +gradlew war+ command would create a new deployment file of +./fred17/build/libs/fred17.war+ .


=== Connect To Anynines

Before we can upload anything, we must connect to anynines, then present our credentials in a login process. You should only need to do this once. After the first time, a small credentials token is stored in your system. This token is used in other steps to let us know who you are and what your choices are.

The credentials we need to log in are stored in the 'cloudfoundry {}' declaration. This way we don't need to repeat the same stuff again and again.

==== Log In

From your terminal session, you'll need to change into the directory created when you unzipped our archive. Typically, this will be the +anynines+ folder. When your session points to this folder, several gradle wrapper commands are available, one for windows systems and another for apple & linux systems. The command to run the build tool is +gradlew+. We use it to 'talk' to our anynines server.

=== Let's Build and Send Our App !

TIP: Martin already has a running +hotdog+ app, so he starts his build with +cf-delete+ to remove it.

Here's a log from a recent project upload to anynines. Martin used a single console command of +
 +gradlew cf-delete war cf-push+ +
and that's it ! Do the same for your app, then sit back and wait or better yet, google a little until your app is available.

WARNING: When you re-deploy (_cf-push_) an app that's already running, it's good practice to delete it first. + 
To do that for your application, use the gradle wrapper command +gradlew cf-delete+ before doing another +gradlew cf-push+ command.


WARNING: Using the +cf-delete+ command when no app currently exists can cause a build failure and the +war+ and +cf-push+ commands will +NOT+ be done.

.Altogether, *PUSH* now !

The gradle wrapper has finished putting your project onto our Anynines server.

"Application +hotdog+ is available at http://hotdog.de.a9sapp.eu[http://hotdog.de.a9sapp.eu]" confirms this app is now
available on the internet. 

Use a web browser to try your own app address in the browser address bar. You should see your app come to life !

== Wrapping It Up

Ok, that's a walk-thru of the deployment of one application to the Anynines PaaS service. +
As the .war file was already created for you, there was not as much work to get it running. +
We'd suggest doing this sesion again until you feel comfortable with it.
