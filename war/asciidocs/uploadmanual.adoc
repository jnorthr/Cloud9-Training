:description: Notes from a sample upload session. A series of notes, joblogs and references from our + 
documentation team. To give you a better understanding of the manual upload process to our platform, we've included a log from a recent upload session using the CF upload coomand line tool.

WARNING: Prior to running the following session, the *anynines.war* file was copied to the *Sample* directory

== Recent Manual Upload Session

Here's the log from a recent upload session. We used the *CF* tool to send our sample war file to anynines. The idea is to get your war file onto the anynines server. Here's the log of how we did it.

[source,ruby]
.What version of the CF tool do we have ?
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents > cf -v
cf 5.4.7
----

NOTE: *CF* version 6 may not work as expected, so use version 5 for now

.Change Into The Sample Folder
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents>cd Sample
----

.What's In This Folder ?
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>dir

 Volume Serial Number is F4EC-EF30

=== Login

The first step before we upload our war file is to gain authorization to use the Anynines service. We use the +cf login+ command to do that. If Martin does not put his email address after the +cf login+ command, the *CF* tool will prompt Martin for his email address. *CF* also confirms which target PaaS service martin is talking to.

.CF Login
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf login martin.j.quickman@googlemail.com
target: https://api.de.a9s.eu
----

WARNING: If your target PaaS provider does not match the api.de.a9s.eu, you'll need to change it before you login. + 
Follow our notes at bottom of this post. Then return here to login again.

=== Let's Send It !

[role="canvas-caption", position="center-up"] 
As you can see from the above, the anynines.war file is the only file in this *Sample* directory folder. That's cos the *CF* tool sends *ALL* files in the current directory to Anynines and we only want to send our *war* file.

TIP: Note that if your current directory was in an unzipped or uncompressed ./war directory, the *CF* command would send the full content with sub-folders, css files, _everything_ goes to Anynines !
 
.Altogether, *PUSH* now !
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf push
----

What's the name of our app going to be when running ? The name we choose here must *NOT* already be in use by someone else. It's the name that's typed when a user wants to access our app from a remote browser. 

Since Martin likes hotdogs, he's going to call his app *HotDog* meaning that users of his deployed app will enter a browser address line of http://hotdog.de.a9sapp.eu[http://hotdog.de.a9sapp.eu]

.What's The App Name Martin ?
----
Name> HotDog
----

.How Many Copies of This App Should Anynines Run ? 
----
Instances> 1
----

If Martin's app becomes _really_ successful, he/we could bump the number of running instances.

.How Much Memory Does This App Need ?
----
1: 128M
2: 256M
3: 512M
4: 1G
Memory Limit> 2
----

Martin chose 256MB of memory for his hotdog.


.CF Response
----
Creating HotDog... OK
----

.Sub-Domains Are Another Topic, So Take Option 1
----
1: HotDog
2: none
Subdomain> HotDog
----

*CF* responds with the Sub-Domain you've chosen: +Subdomain> HotDog+


.Domains Are Another Topic, So Take Option 1
----
1: de.a9sapp.eu
2: none
Domain> de.a9sapp.eu
----

*CF* responds with the Domain you've chosen: +Domain> de.a9sapp.eu+

.CF Responses While Our App Is Sent To Anynines
----
Creating route HotDog.de.a9sapp.eu... OK
Binding HotDog.de.a9sapp.eu to HotDog... OK
----

.Does Your App Need Any Persistence Services ?
----
Create services for application?> n
----

NOTE: As your skillset evolves, you may develop future applications that need to persist some data. Anynines offers several services.

.Should *CF* Save Your Choices From This Session ?
----
Save configuration?> n
----

If we save our session choices, *CF* writes our choices into a text file named +manifest.yml+ so that next time we only need key the command +cf push+ and all our previous answers are used to re-deploy our app. You can use a plain-text editor (not one that puts funny stuff in the file) to change the values of the prior session.

== Anynines Feedback

Ok, GR8 ! How do we find the health of our apps that are running on Anynines ? From time to time, it's nice to be able to verify *what's going on* (apologies to Marvin Gaye!). The *CF* tool has several features to allow that. Here are a few examples, though many more are available if you explore *CF* a bit.

.Display The State Of All Our Applications
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf apps

name     status    usage      url

.Display The Health Of One Single Application By Name
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf app HotDog
HotDog: running
  usage: 256M x 1 instance
  urls: HotDog.de.a9sapp.eu
----

.Which Organizations Does Martin (or You) Have ?
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf orgs
Getting organizations... OK

name
martin_j_quickman_googlemail_com
----

Since we did not declare an organization for this +cf push+ session, the *CF* tool builds a temporary org name using your email address. You can change it later.

Once you become more familiar with Anynines, you'll want to learn our structuring feature for all your apps. You can set up one or more organizations, and within each org, there can be several 'spaces'. Then you can assign an application to one specific space within one organization. It just helps us keep things tidy.

.What Spaces Are In This Organization ?
----
C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Owner.HP-PAVILLION\My Documents\Sample>cf spaces
Getting spaces in martin_j_quickman_googlemail_com... OK

.Display The Health Of One Single Application By Name
----

----

.Now Get Some Metrics About One Specific App
----

----

It's often really useful to diagnose problems by looking at the trail of messages issued as our app runs. We can do that with a log command like so :

.See The Joblog For One Specific App

== Wrapping It Up

Ok, folks, that's a walk-thru of the deployment of one application to the Anynines PaaS service. As the .war file was already created for you, there was not as much work to get it running. We'd suggest you try doing this sesion again until you become comfortable with it.

WARNING: When you re-deploy an app that's already running, it's a good practice to delete the app before re-deployment. + 
For Martin's app, he'd issue the command +cf delete hotdog+ before doing another +cf push+

+++<br />&nbsp;<br />+++


''''

== Change Your Target

There are many  cloud foundry providers these days. Each provider has a different api address for this PaaS service. The Anynines service is located at +https://api.de.a9s.eu+ so follow these steps to re-point your *CF* tool to Anynines.

.What's The Current Target For Our Uploads ?
----
CF target
CF instance: https://api.pivotal.com (API version: 2)
user: martin.j.quickman@googlemail.com
target app space: test in org: martin_j_quickman_googlemail_com
----

.Reset It
----
CF target https://api.de.a9s.eu
target set to https://api.de.a9s.eu
----

Now go back and logon again. *CF* will use the new target address to push to.
